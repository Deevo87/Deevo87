Just a computer science guy trying his best in the job market. My name is Rafał, and here are some things I’m passionate about:
* 🖧 Network programming
* 🌐 Web development with React on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend
* 💡 Experimenting with new programming ideas and concepts
* 🚀 Starting exciting projects (usually they take longer than planned 💀)

What I’m not interested in is unnecessarily overcomplicated code and the mindset behind it. That’s why I always strive to make things as simple as possible while ensuring they are as efficient as they need to be.
